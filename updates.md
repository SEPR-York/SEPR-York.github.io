## Requirements

We have updated the requirements to better highlight the required functional tasks for Assessment 2. Likewise, following the feedback from Assessment 1, contradicting requirements were resolved, and relevant non-functional requirements were added.

## Plan

There have been a few minor updates to the plan, which consist of changing a few deadline dates so that they now read 2017 instead of 2016, and added more information as to why people assigned to task.
